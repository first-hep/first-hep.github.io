The FIRST-HEP project collaborates with a number of other entities to organize training events, including the [HEP Software Foundation (HSF)](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) and the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org/).

We use the HSF Training mailing list for discussions related to planning events:

  * [hsf-training-wg@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-training-wg@googlegroups.com) - mailing list for the HEP Software Foundation Training and Education Working Group- [Subscribe](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-training-wg)

There is also an [Indico category for training planning](https://indico.cern.ch/category/11294/), which is used primarily for a weekly meeting to plan training events. The agendas for specific training events may appear in different Indico categories depending on whether they are associated to other HEP events.
